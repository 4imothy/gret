### TODO

- Maybe call it *gret*: regular expression tree and move away from just todos. Do  *gret TODO -t=example* or smth
- With no pattern given just print out like a tree
- Make work with pipe, stdin?

#### Bugs
- When piping to less make it not show color
- Check if hidden files are searched if not then make it so they are, do another option

#### Optimizations
- Make reading a file faster

#### New Features
- Make option for max depth
- Make an option to search for some other phrase and show it in tree structure
- Make an option to not show some matched thing
- Add a counter for the number of files, number of children, etc.
- Only read comments in files maybe?
