### TODO

#### Bugs
- Completions on zsh (at least) display two rows of what is to be set, should just show one
- Change the pointer type in the map to be weak to avoid memory issues

#### Optimizations
- Make reading a file faster

#### New Features
- Add UI selection menu
- Make work for stdin, not sure how to work with branching
